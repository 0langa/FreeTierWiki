# FreeTierWiki

**Choose free tiers with real constraints, not wishful thinking.**

FreeTierWiki is a decision-first atlas for evaluating free-tier services, tools, and learning resources. It helps developers, indie hackers, startups, and students pick the lowest-risk free-tier options first by comparing services across billing risk, quota shape, and production readiness.

## What Is FreeTierWiki?

Every free tier comes with limits, gotchas, and hidden risks. FreeTierWiki collects hundreds of free-tier offerings—cloud services, developer tools, and learning resources—and evaluates each one on what actually matters:

- **Billing risk** — Will you get surprised by a credit card charge?
- **Quota shape** — Is it always-free, time-limited, credit-based, or a trial?
- **Production readiness** — Can you ship a side project, prototype, or real product?
- **When to use vs. when not to use** — Clear guidance on fit and trade-offs

### What You’ll Find

| Category | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Services** | Hosted platforms and runtimes you build on | Vercel, Fly.io, Supabase, Cloudflare Workers, Azure App Service |
| **Tools** | Products used to build, test, deploy, or operate | Postman, GitHub Actions, Sentry, Terraform, Cypress |
| **Resources** | Learning material and reference docs | freeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, MIT OpenCourseWare |

## Local Development

```bash

```

Build with search index generation:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

FreeTierWiki is configured as a **static Next.js export** for Cloudflare Pages.

Use these Cloudflare Pages settings:

- **Framework preset:** `Next.js (Static HTML Export)`
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Build output directory:** `out`

### Important Notes

- `next.config.mjs` uses `output: "export"`, which is required for static export.
- `images.unoptimized` is enabled for static hosting compatibility.
- `wrangler.toml` points Pages deploys to `out`.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` should usually be left **empty** on Cloudflare Pages unless you intentionally host the site under a subpath.

### Before Deploying

Run a production build locally first:

```bash
npm run build
```

If the build succeeds, Cloudflare Pages should deploy the generated `out/` folder.
